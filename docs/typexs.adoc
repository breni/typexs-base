## Using injections

Singleton object must currently be injected, by giving fixed
string name of the class. (Cross package runtime injection is
tricky because loaded objects can be same but come from different
source path or module loaders)
```

@Inject('Storage')
storage: Storage;

```


## Package versions must be the same

Version of same packages used by typexs-base must be the same,
else it could lead to overlapping of functionality.

```
# example:

wrong:

node_modules/x@0.1.0
node_modules/y/node_modules/x@0.2.0

correct:

node_modules/x@0.2.0
node_modules/y (no node_modules, because dependent version is already present )


```
